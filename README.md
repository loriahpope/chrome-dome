##My first(ish) attempt at learning Ruby on Rails
###It's a Budget Tracker. Or will be. Hopefully.


I tried out a couple of different tutorials before starting this project, including:
-[Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
-[Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
-[Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/levels/1)
